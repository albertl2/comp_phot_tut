# Computational Photography Tutorials

## What's going on here?

You've found code that is currently being drafted. At this time, it is in its first draft where the code is the priority and documentation is thin on the ground.

If you still want to work with what is here, you'll also need to spend some time searching for documentation and relevant papers to fill in the gaps.
